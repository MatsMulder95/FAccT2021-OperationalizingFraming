# Online Study Walk-through

## Online Evaluation in Context of Study

During the study, a novel viewpoint diversification based on the concept of news frames was proposed. During an offline evaluation, the method was found to be capable of increasing the viewpoint diversity score of news article recommendation lists, according to a matric from literature.

Therefore, the diversification method was used in an online experiment to assess the main question of the study:

> _How is reading behaviour affected by viewpoint diverse news recommendations and how they are presented?_

## Blendle Platform
Below, the relevant functionalities of the Blendle platform are described.

### Today Page

The today page can be seen as the central functionality of Blendle on which the daily article selection is presented to a user. This section is composed out of two sections. First, the editorial selection involves the five 'must reads' of the day, according to the editorial team. Secondly, the editorial selection is complemented by a personalised set of articles, generated by the recommender system of Blendle. An example of the today page for a certain user is included in the figure below.

### Reading Page

When an article is selected by the user, a reading page opens in which the content of the article is shown. In the current setup of Blendle, the space below the content of the article on this reading page is used to repeat the not already read articles from the today page. In this way, users are not forced to go back to the today page to continue reading in Blendle. On exameple of the top and bottom of the reading page is included in the figure below:

</p>


## Experimemtal Setup

For the purpose of the experiment, however, a new functionality is implemented which enables the presentation of recommendations on the same topic below the selected article. This section is called "read further on this topic" and can include three different recommendations to the original article. Figure \ref{fig:online-setup-readfurther} provides an example of both the normal functionality, on the left, and the new functionality related to this experiment, on the right.
